# FASTbuild-helloworld
A sample way to define a FASTbuild build script to build a library and link that to a another library to create executable.
Only prequisites are that you have vs2015 installed to the default locations. Enjoy.
The build files are heavily modified from the fbuilds own scripts.
Basically all the other platforms removed to simplify and get atleast one target working.
